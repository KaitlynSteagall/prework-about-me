      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've had a few jobs, but never a career, so that is why I'm here.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Albany, but moved up to Tigard in middle school.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy photography, hiking, video games, and chilling with my cat, dog, ferret, and fish.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not 100% sure! I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now, but I was never
        really sure what I wanted to do. One of my friends is a programmer and after she told me about her job,
        I got really interested and excited to try it. Hoping I can find my dream job in web development!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Aloha</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I feel I've always had more of an analytical mindset.
         I enjoy patterns, puzzles, and problem solving, so I think I'll really enjoy being a web developer!</p>
